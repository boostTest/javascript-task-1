*To complete the tasks use the books array in the src/js/App.js file*
1. Using this array, create an array containing all books with pages below 400
2. Create an array containing all books with pages above 400 and below or equal to 700
3. Create an array containing all books with pages above 700
4. Create an array which returns all books containing JavaScript in their title
5. In the original array that you copied, find the book whose pages when divided by 2 return 50
6. Find the book titled Dopamine
7. From the original array, create new array where each book's pages is doubled
8. From the original array of books return an object where all books are sorted by genre
``` 
    Example :
    const result = {
     classic: [{title: 'JavaScript ES6', pages:'700', genre: 'classic'}],
     best: [{title: 'Dopamine', pages:'200', genre: 'best'}]
    }
```

## Git Rules

1. When starting make a dev branch from master and another for your task
2. Git branches should all be kebab case. Example: 'my-git-branch'
3. Never work in the #master and #dev branches, create a separate branch for every feature that you make
4. Don't make too many branches
5. Once you make a feature branch and you are done working on it
    * Rebase each feature branch into your task branch
    * Merge the feature branch into your task branch and delete it
6. Then you can make another feature branch if needed
7. Commit often, but not too often (at least 3 times per task)
8. Use TortoiseGit and not the console or a IDE
